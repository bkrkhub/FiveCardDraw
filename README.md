# FiveCardDraw
This project is a simulation of the classic Five Card Draw poker game. It allows multiple players to participate in a card game where each player receives a hand of five cards, evaluates the strength of their hand, and chooses which cards to keep or discard based on poker strategies. The game then ranks each hand to determine the winner.

You'll learn how to simulate a win in the Five Card Draw Game, so you can check and make changes to the code. Just enjoy :)
